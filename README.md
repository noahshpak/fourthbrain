# FourthBrain ML Portfolio

The following directories include personal explorations and exercises of a variety of machine learning techniques. Based on the [FourthBrain](https://www.fourthbrain.ai/) curriculum and personal interest, the notebooks exemplify pros and cons of libraries, implementations, and methods. They help me compress some building blocks of machine learning, allowing a quick refresher when I come across a similiar problem. I hope they are helpful to you!
